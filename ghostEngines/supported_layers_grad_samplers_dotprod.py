    This function is handled differently from `_compute_linear_train_grad` because
    LayerNorm's gradient calculations are self-contained. The gradients for both
    its parameters (weight and bias) are computed from the same inputs (A and B).

    - Weight Gradient: Depends on both the input activations `A` (specifically, the
      normalized version of `A`) and the backpropagated gradients `B`.
    - Bias Gradient: Depends only on the backpropagated gradients `B`.

    Because both computations use the same `A` and `B` tensors and are closely
    related, it is cleaner and more efficient to calculate and apply them within
    this single function. This approach avoids passing intermediate results (like
    `normalized_A`) out to a dispatcher.

    Therefore, this function computes and applies the gradients for both weight
    and bias internally and returns `None` to signal to the dispatcher that its
